== Installation ==

There are 3 ways to install Job Manager:

= 1. Automatic installation =
Automatic installation is recommended. This is the easiest option as WordPress natively handles the file
transfers and you don't even need to leave your web browser. An automatic install is really a simple 4 step process.

1. Log in to your WordPress admin panel
2. Select and click on Plugins
3. Top of page click > Add New.
4. Search (Select and Install)

In the search field type "Job Manager" and then "ENTER" from your keyboard. Job Manager will be the
first result on the far left top of the Search Results page. Once you've found the plugin you can view
"More Details" or simply click the "Install Now" button.

Once activated a new menu "Job Manager" will appear in your Admin

= 2. Manual installation (easy way) =
* Download the plugin (.zip file) on the right column of this page
* In your Admin, go to menu Plugins > Add New
* Select the tab "Upload Plugin"
* Upload the .zip file you just downloaded
* Activate the plugin
* A new menu `Job Manager` will appear in your Admin

= 3. Manual installation (FTP) =
The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server
via your favorite File Transfer Protocol (FTP) application/program.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Upload `job-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
* A new menu `Job Manager` will appear in your Admin


* Checkout the current development version from https://github.com/thomastownsend/job-manager

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why am I not reciving emails from Job Manager upon application submission ? =

This has become the most common question for Job Manger over the last 6 months. 99.99% of the time it's a hosting or configuration issue. 
Please reference these threads for more details.(https://wordpress.org/support/topic/applications-not-received-by-email?)

Contact me. (http://www.wp-jobmanager.com/contact-us/), and let me know the language you want to help with?

= How do I setup a custom application form? =

For a full description of how to use the application form customization features, please review the Knowledge base documentation (http://www.wp-jobmanager.com/documentation).

= DOCX files don't download properly =

Apache's `mod_mime_magic` doesn't recognise docx file type properly, and older versions of Apache don't have docx in their mime.types file. You should update your copy of Apache to something more recent, or (if you're unable to update or turn off `mod_mime_magic`) create a .htaccess file as [described here](http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showpost.php?p=898935&postcount=2).

= I can't upload DOC files in WordPress MultiSite =

In your WordPress MultiSite admin, go to Site Admin->Options. Update the "Upload File Types" option to include the various extensions (doc, docx, pdf, odt) that people are likely to upload their resume with.

Job Manager supports added functionality when other plugins are installed. If you think your plugin could add some functionality to Job Manager, please [submit an enhancment request](https://github.com/thomastownsend/job-manager/issues).
